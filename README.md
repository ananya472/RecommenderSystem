# RecommenderSystem

The code extracts user viewing data, stream metadata, and user interests from a Neo4j database. It then builds a recommendation system using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) that suggests streams to users based on collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and user interests. Finally, it combines these recommendations and outputs a list for a specified user.
